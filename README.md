Loan Default Prediction Model

Overview:
This project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting loan defaults using historical data from a German bank. 
The objective is to assist financial institutions in identifying customers at higher risk of defaulting on their loans, thereby improving risk assessment and decision-making processes.

Organization:
The project is organized into several key sections:

1. Introduction: Provides an overview of the problem context and project objectives.
2. Methods and Materials: Describes data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models used.
3. Results: Reports key findings from the analysis, including model performance metrics.
4. Discussion: Provides interpretation of results, discusses implications, limitations, and future directions.
5. Conclusions: Summarizes main findings and conclusions drawn from the study.

Usage:
To replicate the analysis:
1. Obtain the dataset (German_bank.csv) containing historical customer data.
2. Preprocess the dataset, conduct EDA, and train machine learning models.
3. Fine-tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model performance.
4. Interpret results, discuss findings, and draw conclusions.
